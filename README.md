# Project Title: Unit Testing with Jest

## Description
In this project, I implemented various functions and unit tests using the Jest module of Node.js to ensure that the functions were correctly implemented according to the requirements of each statement.

## What I Developed
I implemented several functions to fulfill the proposed requirements and/or unit tests to ensure that the implementations of the functions were correct, according to what was being requested in each statement.

### I was able to:
- Write unit tests using the Jest module of Node.js to verify the correct functioning of the functions.
- Write functions so that they met the implemented tests.
- Write tests and functions using a test-driven development approach.

## Development
In the unit tests that were not implemented, I encountered the command `fail('Empty test!')`, which existed intentionally to make the test fail.
This piece of code was removed from the moment I started writing the unit test.

Without `fail('Empty test!')` in the blocks that did not yet contain test code, the result would have been a false positive, meaning that the tested function would pass successfully even without having actually implemented the test.

### Main Technologies and Tools:
- Jest: A testing framework for JavaScript projects.
